Some serious problems that i had encountered was figuring out the calculations for sierpinski. Other problems i encountered
were in the fractal part of the project, figuring out any interesting design was difficult to come up with.

I simply altered one of the fractals provided (spiral) and made it into a different interesting spiral.
